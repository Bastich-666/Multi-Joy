# Multi-Joy
A simple way of connecting classic 9 pin joysticks to modern systems via Arduino USB.

I made myself an dual 9 pin joystick adapter (Arduino USB HID) the other day (slow real work day) 
and wanted to share it with everyone. My main reason for doing this is that I have seen some quite 
extortionate prices for other adapters on eBay etc. All in this project cost me less than Â£5 and 
a couple of hours soldering and coding (all good fun).

This sketch requires an additional library which was produced by Matthew Heironimus, his most excellent 
library can be downloaded from: https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary

Hope this helps other people  get their retro joysticks working on modern systems :)
